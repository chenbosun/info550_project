# info550_project


The dataset I use is from the Kaggle website which is about the rubik's cube solve time. 

The columns I may use are name or rank, time and country. 

I want to use a two sample t test to analysis if there is a big difference of the average time people used between two specific countries. 

The output should include a summary table(mean, range...) of the time they used and a figure of rank to time. 

R and "ggplot2" package may be used to complete my workflow.
